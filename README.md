# Sleep-CPC: Contrastive Predictive Coding for EEG-Based Sleep Staging

This repository contains the implementation of our proposed model `SleepCPC`.

Still working on it...

# Basic Usage

There are two versions of starting scripts:
- `main.py`: Run the code in single GPU mode.
- `train.py` and `evaluate.py`: Run the code distributed mode. The training procedure is organized into two files. `train.py` contains representation learning and `evalute.py` includes fine-tuning and evaluation processes.
